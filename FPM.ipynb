    "#  Frequent Pattern Mining and Association Rule Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "A **frequent pattern** is a pattern, such as a set of items, subsequences, or substructures, that frequently occurs in a dataset. **Frequent pattern mining** searches for such recurring relationships in a given data set.\n",
    "For example, a **frequent itemset** is a set of items, such as bread and milk, that frequently appear together in a transaction data set. A subsequence, such as buying first a PC, then a digital camera, and then a memory card, if it frequently occurs in a shopping history database, is a **frequent sequential pattern**. A substructure can refer to different structural forms, such as subgraphs, subtrees, or sublattices. If A substructure frequently occurs in a graph database is called a **frequent structural pattern**. Frequent pattern mining is also known as **frequent episode mining** or **affinity analysis**. In this notebook, we will focus on mining itemsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical example of frequent itemset mining is market basket analysis. This process analyzes customer buying habits by finding associations between the different items that customers place in their \"shopping baskets.\" The discovery of these associations can help retailers develop marketing strategies by gaining insight into which items are frequently purchased together by customers. For instance, if customers buy milk, how likely are they to also buy bread (and what kind of bread) on the same trip to the supermarket? This information can lead to increased sales by helping retailers do selective marketing and plan their shelf space. \n",

    "In this dataset, bread and butter occur together in 60% of the transactions. So the occurrence of {bread, butter} is a frequent pattern. How can we take advantage of this knowledge? In one strategy, items that are frequently purchased together can be placed in proximity to further encourage the combined sale of such items. In an alternative strategy, placing bread and butter at opposite ends of the store may entice customers who purchase such items to pick up other items along the way. \n",

    "A transaction database contains sets of items (itemsets) together with additional information. For example, a transaction in the database contains a transaction ID and an itemset. Collections of itemsets used for transaction databases can be represented as **binary incidence matrices** with columns corresponding to the items and rows corresponding to the itemsets. The matrix entries represent the presence (1) or absence (0) of an item in a particular itemset. Shown below on the left, an example of a binary incidence matrix containing itemsets for above supermarket data example and vertical layout for the same is shown on right. \n",

    "A set of items is referred to as an **itemset**. An itemset that contains $k$ items is a $k$-itemset. The set {bread, butter} is a 2-itemset. The **occurrence frequency** of an itemset is the number of transactions that contain the itemset. This is also known, simply, as the **frequency**, **support count**, or **count** of the itemset. If the support of an itemset satisfies a prespecified **minimum support threshold**, then the itemset is a frequent itemset. \n"

    "\n",
    "**Apriori** Method is a basic algorithm for finding frequent itemsets. Apriori employs an iterative approach known as a level-wise search, where k-itemsets are used to explore (k + 1)-itemsets. First, the set of frequent 1-itemsets is found by scanning the database to accumulate the count for each item, and collecting those items that satisfy minimum support. The resulting set is denoted by L1. Next, L1 is used to find L2, the set of frequent 2-itemsets, which is used to find L3, and so on, until no more frequent k-itemsets can be found. The finding of each Lk requires one full scan of the database. To improve the efficiency of the level-wise generation of frequent itemsets, an important property called the Apriori property is used to reduce the search space.\n",

    "### Step 2: Generating Association Rules from Frequent Itemsets\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequent itemset patterns can be represented in the form of **association rules.** For example, the information that customers who purchase bread also tend to buy butter at the same time is represented in the following association rule: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "bread => butter [support = 60%, confidence = 75%]. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequent if-then associations called association rules which consists of an **antecedent** (if) and a **consequent** (then). Rule **support** and **confidence** are two measures of rule interestingness. They respectively reflect the usefulness and certainty of discovered rules. A support of 60% for a rule means that 60% of all the transactions under analysis show that bread and butter are purchased together. A confidence of 75% means that 75% of the customers who purchased bread also bought butter. Typically, association rules are considered **interesting** if they satisfy both a **minimum support threshold** and a **minimum confidence threshold**. These thresholds can be set by users or domain experts. Additional analysis can be performed to discover interesting statistical correlations between associated items. \n",
    "\n",
    "**A formal definition of association rules is as follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $I = {i_1, i_2, . . . , i_n}$ be a set of **items**. Let $D = {t_1, t_2, . . . , t_m}$\n",
    "be a set of **transactions called the database**. Each transaction in $D$ has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in $I$. A **rule** is defined as an implication of the form $X \\Rightarrow Y$ where $X,Y \\subseteq I$ and $X \\cap Y = \\emptyset$. The sets of items (for short **itemsets**) $X$ and $Y$ are called **antecedent** (LHS) and **consequent** (RHS) of the rule, respectively."
